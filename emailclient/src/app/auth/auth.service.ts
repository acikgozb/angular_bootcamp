  isSignedIn$ = new BehaviorSubject<null | boolean>(null);

  //! Problem: We need to store the value of whether or not the user is signed in.

  //! Solution 1: Using a boolean field, simply toggle with functions.
  //! Not enough because: It is really hard to tell to other components when this simple boolean field is changed.
  //! To notice other components and make them "react" to this change, we need to create an Observable.

  //! Solution 2: Using an Observable.
  //! Not enough because: We need to be able to manually emit values from outside of the Observable.

  //! using a plain Observable does not suffice for cases where outside code wants to emit from an Observable.
  //! the only time where an Observable emits a value, is in it's callback function.
  //! To bypass this limitation, we can use a Subject which is both a subscriber and an observer.
  //! it is possible to call .next() from outside with a Subject.

  //! Solution 3: Using a Subject.
  //! Not enough because: Since it is a hot Observable, it doesn't emit values when a component subscribes.
  //! It only emits when it is triggered thus any components which subscribed late might miss the current value.

  //! Also we need to have a default value for isSignedIn state which is not possible with Subjects.

  //! REQUIREMENTS FOR REAL SOLUTION:

  //! 1 - We must be able to get it to emit a new value "from the outside",
  //! 2 - We must be able to give it a default, or starting, value,
  //! 3 - New subscribers must be given the value from it immediately after subscribing.

  //! Real solution: Enter BehaviorSubject.

  //! BehaviorSubject can get a default value, allow others to emit values and new subscribers will get the latest value when they are subscribed.
